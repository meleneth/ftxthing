This is the design doc at the moment, none of the below is implemented.

At the start, for dev purposes, this is scoped as an autobattler that the machine itself plays - this is basically a advanced version of Progress Quest.

The Loop:
Go to (Area) kill monsters get loot
return to town, heal up
craft gear, maintain gear
on level up, progress skills (assuming skills are level-cap based)
get consumables
goto 11

# Story

We start in a small village, and life is simple enough. As we get to a certain level, the village is attacked and we must explore the larger world.

A core part of the progression is that we start in a small village, w/no magic - just normal swords / daggers / maces etc. at 25% into the game, we start seeing magic. at 50%, we start seeing modern weapons. at 75%, we start seeing cyber + lazer weapons. (modern / magic introductions are still 'up in the air' for ordering)

This progression means that old defenses are invalidated as we move 'chapters'. This implies at the least gearing resets, and possibly different sets of gear depending on what types of enemies you are expecting to encounter.

# Questions

How is area selected? is it level locked or ability to kill locked?
is creature selection biome based?
what damage types do we have?
what are caps for resistances?
what are the damage reduction formulas?

# Skills

so by default, you don't know anything
but you venture into the forest, and a field mouse uses Thump on you
and then you learn the skill Thump
and the power spiral begins

we're making 5's a thing here. so each acccount has 5 parties, each party has 5 members, and each party member has 5 skills.

Skills can be abandoned at any time. Some skills will leave behind permanent buffs even when abandoned, others require the skill to be learned (and optionally levelled!) for their effects.

We're going to need tags for the skills. Thump is a damage, physical skill. It doesn't use any weapons.

## how does experience work?

Level cap is 100
at level 1, you need to kill 10 things to get to level 2
at level 70, you would need to kill 710 things to get to level 71

# Drops

Loot tables are biome based
Each monster type has a specific rare drop
most monsters do not drop currency, but they do drop trash that merchants will buy
bag full = go sell

# Farming minigame

Grow reagents for consumables, seeds are purchasable or available as drops in certain biomes
plot size and time passing
mutations?

# Consumables

- Healing Potion (1 for each 10 levels)

# The Code

We currently have a god object, GrandCentral. Nothing else is allowed to know about GrandCentral, it's just the owner for all the things.

AppContext has log*, registry*, and rng\_.
